# BlockPlot
A productivity website that aims to help you realize your ambitions and aspirations in building skills!

## Inspiration
Blockplot is based on a motivational method that uses the idea of chaining together blocks or squares graphically for any effort spent.

## How It Works
With BlockPlot, you create skill blocks that represent skills you wish to become proficient in. These skill blocks contain both information about the skill in question, as well as a block grid that represents everyday of a given year. Whenever you put time into working a skill, the block representing the day that skill was practiced will be plotted with a color. The intensity of the color will be dependant on the amount of time spent practicing that skill. 

Time data used to plot progress on block grids is pulled from external time tracking services. Currently only [RescueTime](www.rescuetime.com) support is in the works. Support for more services is planned.
Keeping user data pulled from these external APIs on any sort of backend is not an objective, as I wish to respect user data privacy and leave the user in control of their own data. If this service ends up seeing much use though, storing data on a backend may become a necessity in order to control resource costs. Regardless, permission and control pertaining to user data will completely rest with the user.
